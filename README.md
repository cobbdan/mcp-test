# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server

## Overview

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized protocol designed to facilitate communication between Large Language Models (LLMs) and external tools or services. An MCP server acts as an intermediary layer that enables LLMs to interact with various tools and data sources in a structured and consistent manner.

## Key Features

### 1. Standardized Communication
- Provides a uniform interface for LLMs to interact with external tools
- Defines consistent patterns for request/response handling
- Enables seamless integration of new tools and capabilities

### 2. Tool Management
- Handles tool registration and discovery
- Manages tool execution and response processing
- Provides tool validation and error handling

### 3. Context Management
- Maintains conversation context across interactions
- Handles state management for ongoing dialogues
- Enables context-aware tool selection and execution

## Built-in Tools

### Lorem Ipsum Generator
The server includes a built-in lorem ipsum text generator tool that can be used to generate placeholder text.

**Tool Name:** `loremIpsum`

**Parameters:**
- `paragraphs` (number, optional): Number of paragraphs to generate (default: 1)
- `minSentences` (number, optional): Minimum sentences per paragraph (default: 3)
- `maxSentences` (number, optional): Maximum sentences per paragraph (default: 7)

**Example Usage:**
```json
POST /execute/loremIpsum
{
  "paragraphs": 2,
  "minSentences": 3,
  "maxSentences": 5
}
```

## How It Works

1. **Tool Registration**: Tools register their capabilities with the MCP server, including:
   - Function names and descriptions
   - Required and optional parameters
   - Expected response formats

2. **Request Processing**:
   - LLM sends structured requests to the MCP server
   - Server validates and routes requests to appropriate tools
   - Tools execute requested operations
   - Results are formatted and returned to the LLM

3. **Context Handling**:
   - Server maintains conversation history
   - Tracks tool usage and outcomes
   - Ensures consistent state across interactions

## Benefits

- **Standardization**: Common interface for tool integration
- **Flexibility**: Easy addition of new tools and capabilities
- **Reliability**: Robust error handling and validation
- **Maintainability**: Centralized management of tool interactions
- **Scalability**: Supports multiple tools and concurrent requests

## Implementation Considerations

- **Security**: Implement proper authentication and authorization
- **Error Handling**: Robust error management and recovery
- **Performance**: Optimize for quick response times
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring
- **Documentation**: Maintain clear documentation for tools and interfaces

## Best Practices

1. **Tool Design**:
   - Clear function signatures
   - Comprehensive parameter validation
   - Meaningful error messages
   - Proper documentation

2. **Server Configuration**:
   - Secure communication channels
   - Appropriate rate limiting
   - Monitoring and alerting
   - Regular maintenance and updates

3. **Integration**:
   - Follow protocol specifications
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Maintain backward compatibility
   - Regular testing and validation

## Getting Started

To implement an MCP server:

1. Set up the server environment
2. Configure tool registration
3. Implement request handling
4. Add authentication and security measures
5. Set up monitoring and logging
6. Test thoroughly
7. Deploy and maintain

## Running the Server

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## Testing

```bash
npm test
```
